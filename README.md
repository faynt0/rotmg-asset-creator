# RotMG Asset Ripper

Extracts assets from Realm of the Mad God Unity game files and recompiles the new sprite atlases into legacy-format spritesheets. Includes a built-in Unity `.assets` file parser — no external tools required.

## Features

- **Unity Asset Parser** — Reads `resources.assets` directly, extracting Texture2D and TextAsset data without needing AssetRipper or other external binaries.
- **Spritesheet Recompiler** — Reconstructs classic spritesheets from the modern atlas format using FlatBuffers sprite data.
- **Muledump Renderer** — Generates `constants.js`, `renders.png`, and `sheets.js` for use with [Muledump](https://github.com/jakcodex/muledump).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+)
- npm

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript source via Rollup into `out/index.js`.

For development with automatic rebuilds:

```bash
npm run watch
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Place your RotMG `resources.assets` file in `source-assets/` (or update `default_config.json` with its path).
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Run:

```bash
node out/index.js
```

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `--resources <path>` | Path to the RotMG `resources.assets` file |
| `--dest <path>` | Output directory for generated content |
| `--config <path>` | Path to a custom `config.json` (default: `./config.json`) |

Arguments override values in `default_config.json`.

**Example:**

```bash
node out/index.js --resources /path/to/resources.assets --dest /path/to/output
```

### Configuration

**`default_config.json`** — Sets `resources` and `dest` paths used when CLI arguments are not provided:

```json
{
  "resources": "./source-assets/resources.assets",
  "dest": "./data"
}
```

**`config.json`** — Controls pipeline behavior. Uses `[[resources]]` and `[[dest]]` as placeholders resolved from CLI args or `default_config.json`:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `decompile` | Whether to run the Unity asset extraction step |
| `decompiler.input` / `output` | Input assets file and extraction output directory |
| `input` / `output` | Atlas input directory and spritesheet output directory |
| `manifestLocation` | Path to `assets_manifest.xml` |
| `copy` | Map of atlas names to copy as aliases |
| `render` | Settings for the Muledump renderer (`source`, `dest`, `gameVersion`, `buildHash`) |

## Output

After a successful run the `dest` directory will contain:

```
dest/
├── atlases/          # Extracted raw atlas files
├── sheets/           # Recompiled legacy spritesheets (PNG)
├── xml/              # Extracted XML game data
└── render-output/
    ├── constants.js  # Item, class, skin, pet, and texture data
    ├── sheets.js     # Base64-encoded sprite sheets
    └── renders.png   # Recompiled spritesheet
```
